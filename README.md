# UK Locate

The [OS Locate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.oslocate.android) app was great, unfortunately it has been discontinued. The alternative is buried in the [OS Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.osmaps) app, which requires an account.

It would be nice just to use a simple offline web app instead. That definitely seems doable, and there are already a few similar examples around:

- https://lamplightdev.github.io/compass/
- https://locus.plus/

I'd still quite like something more like the old OS Locate though, and who doesn't need an extra side project?!

The new OS Locate UI is pretty nice when you can get to it:

Good grief, I thought the compass would be the easy bit!
