# UK Locate

The [OS Locate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.oslocate.android) app was great, unfortunately it has been discontinued. The alternative is buried in the [OS Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ordnancesurvey.osmaps) app, which requires an account.

It would be nice just to use a simple offline web app instead. That definitely seems doable, and there are already a few similar examples around:

 I'd still quite like something more like the old OS Locate though, and who doesn't need an extra side project?!

 To be continued...
